# SchemaDB

A dataset of ~2500 relational SQL anonymised schemas found on github.

Included in this release are primarily:
* Reparsed Schema (MySql Compatible)
* NetworkX graphs (pickled)

Additionally included is the extraction script used to generate these files.
This script assumes the existances of a 'repos' directory in the same directory
containing cloned github repositories.
The script will attempt to find one candidate schema per repository.

## Requirements
Beyond those imports listed, for the purposes of licensing we have removed
the MySql grammar files (.g4) used to generate the parsers used in the extraction
process. We leave included our bespoke code designed to traverse a MySql parse
tree generated by ANTLR4. Various MySql ANTLR4 grammars can be found publicly,
however we do not guarantee compatability with the extraction script. We strongly
suggest the use of the official MySql ANTLR grammar as published by both the ANTLR
and MySql projects.

The grammar files were processed with ANTLRv4.9.2, and this should be used to
regenerate the MySql target as:
`antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 MySql.g4`
